//! Intrusive structure support in Rust.
//!
//! An intrusive structure is a general-purpose structure directly
//! embedded within a containing structure, in order to add that
//! general-purpose facility to the container. As an example, one
//! might use an intrusive "link" structure to allow objects to be
//! organized in a linked-list:
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```test_harness
//! # #[macro_use]
//! # extern crate containerof;
//! # use containerof::*;
//! struct Link {
//!     next: Option<ContainerLink>,
//! }
//! struct List {
//!     head: Option<ContainerLink>,
//!     tail: Option<ContainerLink>,
//! }
//!
//! struct Container {
//!     link: Link,
//! }
//! containerof_intrusive!(ContainerLink = Container:link::Link);
//! ```
